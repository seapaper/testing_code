    <h2>How exciting</h2>
    <p>Yaaass, that really <em>is</em> exciting.
        <strong>Warning:</strong> level of excitement may cause
        head to explode. </p>
    <p>After I deleted all of my trash extensions.
        I came back with newly learned feature called
        <br> actually I am not sure if it is working hahaha</p>
    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>It seems stange</p>
    <p>In the present work, we train a simple CNN with
        one layer of convolution on top of word vectors
        obtained from an unsupervised neural language
        model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et
        al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News,
        and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the
        word vectors static and learn only the other parameters
        of the model. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters,
        this simple model achieves excellent
        results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that
        the pre-trained vectors are 'universal' feature extractors
        that can be utilized for various classification
        tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through
        fine-tuning results in further improvements. We
        finally describe a simple modification to the architecture
        to allow for the use of both pre-trained and
        task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.</p>

    <p>So I asked Bob about quotations on the Web and he said <q>I know as much about quotations as I do about pigeon
            fancying</q>. Luckily, I found HTML Dog and it said:</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/text/">
        <p>blockquote and q are used for quotations. blockquote is generally used for standalone often multi-line
            quotations whereas q is used for shorter, in-line quotations.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>According to <cite>the Bible</cite>, after six days God said <q>screw this for a lark, I'm having a nap</q>.</p>

    <p id=t_area>I want to tell you a story.
        No, not the story of how, in 1991, Linus Torvalds wrote the first version of the Linux kernel.
        You can read that story in lots of Linux books. Nor am I going to tell you the story of
        how, some years earlier, Richard Stallman began the GNU Project to create a free Unixlike
        operating system. That's an important story too, but most other Linux books have that
        one, as well.
        No, I want to tell you the story of how you can take back control of your computer.
        When I began working with computers as a college student in the late 1970s, there was a
        revolution going on. The invention of the microprocessor had made it possible for ordinary
        people like you and me to actually own a computer. It's hard for many people today
        to imagine what the world was like when only big business and big government ran all
        the computers. Let's just say, you couldn't get much done.</p>
